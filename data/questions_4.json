      }
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A) Multi-Level Inheritance vs. Multiple Inheritance:\n\n\nMulti-Level Inheritance: In multi-level inheritance, a class is derived from another class, which in turn is derived from another class. It forms a chain of inheritance. For example, if class C is derived from class B, and class B is derived from class A, this is multi-level inheritance.\n\n\nMultiple Inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a class is derived from more than one base class. This means a single class can inherit properties and behaviors from multiple parent classes. For example, if class C is derived from both class A and class B, this is multiple inheritance.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "B) Core Features of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\nThe core features of OOP include:\n\n\nEncapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, typically a class, and restricting access to some of the object's components.\n\n\nInheritance: The ability to create a new class from an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods, and allowing for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical class relationships.\n\n\nPolymorphism: The ability to use a single interface for entities of different types, often allowing a single symbol or method to represent different underlying forms (types).\n\n\nAbstraction: The concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object, allowing the focus to be on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",

      }
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "C) Aggregation Relation:\n\n\nAggregation is a special form of association between two classes where one class (the aggregate) contains a collection of instances of another class. It represents a \"has-a\" relationship and implies a weaker relationship than composition, meaning the lifecycle of the contained objects is not managed by the aggregate.\n\n\nIn terms of constructors, aggregation implies that the constructor of the aggregate class may initialize or use instances of the aggregated class, but it does not manage their lifecycle. The aggregated objects can exist independently of the aggregate.\n\n\n",

    "explanation": "D) Characteristics of a Constructor:\n\n\nA constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created.\n\n\nIt has the same name as the class and does not have a return type, not even void.\n\n\nConstructors can be overloaded, meaning a class can have multiple constructors with different parameters.\n\n\nThey are used to initialize the object's state, often by setting initial values for the object's attributes.\n\n\nIf no constructor is defined in a class, most programming languages provide a default constructor.\n\n",

The company has\nmany members of staff: Captains, Co-Pilots, and Hosts. The company also wants to store information\nabout its flight journeys.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This is a design question. A good solution would involve an `Employee` base class with common attributes like `ID` and `Name`. `Captain`, `CoPilot`, and `Host` would inherit from `Employee` and add their specific attributes. A separate `Flight` class would manage flight information. It might also have a `Time` class or struct. The relationship between `Flight` and the staff would be an association (a flight has staff members assigned to it).\n\n```cpp\n// Base Class for all employees\nclass Employee {\nprotected:\n    int ID;\n    char* name;\npublic:\n    Employee(int id, const char* n);\n    // ... getters and setters ...\n};\n\n// Derived Classes\nclass Captain : public Employee {\nprivate:\n    char* nationality;\npublic:\n    Captain(int id, const char* n, const char* nat);\n    // ... getters and setters ...\n};\n\nclass CoPilot : public Employee {\nprivate:\n    char* position;\npublic:\n    CoPilot(int id, const char* n, const char* pos);\n    // ... getters and setters ...\n};\n\nclass Host : public Employee {\nprivate:\n    char* dutyDetails;\npublic:\n    Host(int id, const char* n, const char* duty);\n    // ... getters and setters ...\n};\n\n// A helper class for time\nclass Time {\n    // ... members for hour, minute, second ...\n};\n\n// Separate class for Flight information\nclass Flight {\nprivate:\n    char* sourceCity;\n    char* destinationCity;\n    Time departureTime;\n    Time landingTime;\n    // Could also have associations to staff, e.g.,\n    // Captain* flightCaptain;\npublic:\n    Flight(const char* src, const char* dest, Time dt, Time lt);\n    // ... getters and setters ...\n};\n```",
